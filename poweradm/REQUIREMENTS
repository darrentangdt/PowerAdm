#Requirements

## General

### First: 
There are no guarantees of the author. Use at your own risk. Check the [License file](https://github.com/kairoaraujo/PowerAdm/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Infrastructure

You need a *nix (Linux or Unix) with Python >= 2.6 <= 3

To install check the [INSTALL](https://github.com/kairoaraujo/PowerAdm/blob/master/INSTALL) file.

## HMC

Works with HMC v7.

HMC v8 Not tested yeat

## Environment to create LPAR

### Maximum number of LPARs
You need to determine the maximum number of LPAR in your environment. Try to determine a number for their memory and CPUs and the amount of frames.

For example in my environment determined 500. And I think this number is relatively large.

### Maximum number of Virtual Adapter on VIOs Servers
Configuration > Manager Profiles > Virtual Adapters check 'Maximum number of Virtual Adapters'

The rule:

In his VIO require the Virtual Adapter Maximum Number is 3+ _"maximum number of LPARs"_ that you calculate the primary VIO and 4+ "maximum number of LPARs"_ that you calculate the secondary VIO.

Remember the _Maximum number of LPARs_ I determined as 500.

Example
- On my VIO primary is 3500 
- On my VIO secundary is 4500

### Validate VIOs 'Adapter ID'
On the VIOs Profile (Configuration > Manager Profiles > Virtual Adapters) check de largest Adapter ID.

**How the Virtual Adapters in VIO are created by the Power Adm:**

The rule is:
- 1+'LPAR ID' to first virtual SCSI on Primary VIO
- 2+'LPAR ID' to second virtual SCSI on Second VIO
- 3+'LPAR ID' to first virtual Fiber Channel (HBA) on Primary VIO
- 4+'LPAR ID' to second virtual Fiber Channel (HBA) on Second VIO

Example:

LPAR ID = 30

- 130 to first virtual SCSI on Primary VIO
- 230 to second virtual SCSI on Second VIO
- 330 to first virtual Fiber Channel (HBA) on Primary VIO
- 430 to second virtual Fiber Channel (HBA) on Second VIO

In LPAR configuration is always this:
- 10 to First virtual Ethernet Adapter
- 11 to Second virtual Ethernet Adapter (if added)
- 12 to Third virtual Ethernet Adapter (if added)
- 21 to First virtual SCSI (if added)
- 22 to Second virtual SCSI (if added)
- 33 to first virtual Fiber Channel/HBA/NPIV (if added)
- 34 to second virtual Fiber CHannel/HBA/NPIV (if added)

**!! It is important to understand this to know how to adjust your environment to support the PowerAdm !!**

**You will need to manually create an LPAR with ID greater than its largest existing 'Adapter ID'.**

**If exist in my environment LPAR with this ID or largest must get the next.**

It is easier to understand with an example:

1. On my Primary VIO the largest 'Adapter ID' is 127

2. On my Secound VIO the largest 'Adapter ID' is 110

3. I need to manually create an LPAR with ID 28 with this configuration.

4. If exists in my environment LPARs with IDs 28, 29, 30 will need to use the ID 31

5. Create Manually LPAR with ID 31

After creating the LPAR manually (LPAR ID 31), if I use the 'Power Adm' to create a new she will get the ID 32.

Its configuration will look like in the VIO:
- 132 to first virtual SCSI on Primary VIO
- 232 to second virtual SCSI on Second VIO 
- 332 to first virtual Fiber Channel (HBA) on Primary VIO
- 432 to second virtual Fiber Channel (HBA) on Second VIO

**TIPs:** 

I need more two virtual Fiber Channel, how to procced?

1. on the Primary VIO create manually 432
2. on the Secound VIO create manually 332

on the LPAR use free IDs: 
- 13,15,16,17,18 and 19 free to manually use for virtual network
- 23..29 free to manually use for virtual scsi adapters
- 33..39 free to manually use for virtual Fiber CHannel/HBA/NPIV

It's great! :+1: 

## Environment to Deploy OS Using a NIM Server

### NIM Server

You need an NIM Server configured and working.
 
 Need install SUDO on the NIM 
 Check install on [INSTALL](https://github.com/kairoaraujo/PowerAdm/blob/master/INSTALL) file.
